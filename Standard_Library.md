# Python Standard Library Quick Reference

## Overview

This markdown contains a list of great standard libary, built in functions that can be used during coding challenges, classes projects, and white board coding to boost perfomance, limit lines of codes, and give a more pythonic syntax.


## Why

After taking my coding challenge for the 2019 Software Engineering Intership with JP Morgan, I realisezd that if I will be using python for coding challenges and plan on succeeding, I must know it and its tricks like the back of my hand.

1. Slicing

You can slice elements with [start:end] operator :
```python

list_one = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

    answer_one = list_one[1:4] # gets elements from 1st to 5th index exclusive
    
   # gets all even numbers from 1st to 8th elementself.
    # :2 tells python to increment by 2
    answer_two = list_one[1:7:2]
    
        # get list backward
    backward_list = list_one[::-1]

```
